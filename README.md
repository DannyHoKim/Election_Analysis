## Challenge Overview

This challenge required the Data Anaylist to use the "election_data.csv" source within Python and VS Code to gather data that represented the needs of the client. In this challenge, I imported and inspected the data, opened txt files to hold the desired data, loaded files from a path, and created loops and conditionals to iterate through the data and print out the desired data.
